          <h5>ABOUT CALLAN</h5>
          <p><strong>In past lives</strong> I was a marketer, a writer, a project manager, and a <strong>tooth fairy</strong> (not a joke). I always believed the things I loved (<em>numbers, creativity, building things, solving mysteries, staring at a screen for hours </em>{<em>sometimes cursing</em>}) couldn't be combined into one tiny job. But then I found it. Software development. I was introduced into the world gradually by the development team at a start-up I worked for.</p>
          <p><strong>Once I got my hands dirty,</strong> I couldn't stop. I threw myself heart-and-soul into a Software Development Bootcamp, learning technologies, creating projects, developing solutions, leading teams and burning the candle at both ends to get the most I possibly could out of the endless resources provided.</p>
          <p><strong>In the wild</strong> I'm a dog person with a 5th grade sense of humor.</p>
          <p>Learn more about my story of what drew me to development and what I've been up to at NSS in <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/relationary/bcn17-callan-morrison?in=relationary/sets/barcamp-nashville-2017">this podcast</a> with BJ Burns of The Complete Developer Podcast.</p>
